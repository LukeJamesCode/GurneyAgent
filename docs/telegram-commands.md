## Core commands

Always available. No extension required.

| Command        | Arguments     | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `/fresh`       | —             | Owner-only destructive fresh rebuild from Telegram: update checkout, wipe `~/.gurney`, then run the Telegram setup wizard.                    |
| `/cancelsetup` | —             | Cancel an active `/setup` or `/fresh` wizard.                                                                                                 |

### Fresh/setup from Telegram

`/setup` and `/fresh` are owner-only because they can rewrite config, enable extensions, and collect extension secrets.
They are intended for the case where Gurney is already reachable over Telegram and you want to rebuild or reconfigure a remote host without SSH.

| Command        | What it does                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/setup`       | Runs the setup wizard in chat without wiping existing state. It saves `config.json`, presets bundled extension enable/disable rows, and walks auth/settings. |
| `/fresh`       | Requires an exact `YES` confirmation, runs the same update path as `/update`, wipes `~/.gurney`, then runs the setup wizard in chat.                         |
| `/cancelsetup` | Cancels the active wizard for your Telegram user. You can also reply `cancel` to any setup prompt.                                                           |

Telegram cannot send a truly blank response, so the wizard tells you when to reply `default` to keep a shown default value.
After a successful `/fresh` or `/setup`, run `/doctor` to verify the new config and `/restart` to boot the process with the rebuilt config/extension set.

`/setup` and `/fresh` still require the current bot process to be reachable first; keep the existing token during the wizard if you want to stay on the same Telegram bot.

## gurney-memgraph — planned, v1.4

The `/memory`, `/remember`, and `/forget` commands shipped during 0.x and will return when `gurney-memgraph` lands as an official extension again in v1.4. See the [Roadmap](../README.md#roadmap).

## gurney-tts

| Command  | Arguments                 | What it does                                                                          |

## Notes

### Command suggestions in Telegram

When Gurney starts (or restarts), it calls `setMyCommands` to register all active slash commands with Telegram. Type `/` in the chat to see the suggestion menu. Commands from newly installed extensions appear after the next `gurney ext reload` or bot restart.

### LLM tools vs. slash commands

Many capabilities are available both as slash commands and as LLM tools. Slash commands give you direct, predictable control. LLM tools let you use natural language — "what's the weather in Oslo?" routes to `get_weather` without needing `/weather Oslo`. Either approach works; use whichever fits the moment.

### Per-chat state

`/devmode`, `/voice`, and conversation context are all per-chat. Toggling devmode in one chat doesn't affect another.
